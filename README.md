# Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript

# Project goals

- The main goal of this project was to learn how Javascript Promises work, particularly async and await.

# Features

- Makes fetch requests to get data from the Weather API
- Search for any city and the current data, including local time, temperature and condition will be displayed
- Displays the next 12 hours of weather, adjusting for the city's local time.
- I created this app when I had a free trial of the Weather API which allowed access to the daily and weekly forecast, but after it ran out I could only access the next 3 days of weather so I had to change it!
